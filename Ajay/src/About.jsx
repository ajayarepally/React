            <p>
                Hello! I’m a passionate developer dedicated to building sleek, efficient, and accessible web experiences. With a strong foundation in front-end technologies and a keen eye for design, I strive to create interfaces that are not only functional but also visually compelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, improving my skills, and contributing to open-source projects. Let’s build something amazing together!
